## General Information
- Motivation: Interested in learning a foundational knowledge of machine learning algorithms. This project provided a great introduction into machine learning libraries and the general process and steps taken in constructing a model from scratch.
- Skills Learned: Debugging, terminal commands, encapsulation of application functionality into multiple modules and machine learning algorithms/libraries.


## How to Run
1. Run the main() function in the process_data.py module - This will extract the data from the csv source files, transform, and load the data to a sqlite data table. Example from root directory: "python process_data.py disaster_messages.csv disaster_categories.csv DisasterResponse.db"
3. Run the main() function in the train_classifier.py module - This will use the sqlite data table to train a machine learning model. The model is dumped to a pickle file. Example from root directory: "python train_classifier.py DisasterResponse.db classifier.pkl"
4. Run the terminal command "python run.py" in the app directory to run the web app
5. Go to http://127.0.0.1/


## Files
- disaster_categories.csv - csv file that houses categorical message data used in training set
- disaster_messages.csv - csv file that houses message body data used in training set
- process_data.py - python3 file that extracts, transforms and loads data from csv files and returns a sqlite database
- train_classifier.py - python3 file that accesses the sqlite database from process_data.py and trains a random forest model (utilizing MultiOutputClassifier) that can predict message category. Returns a pickle file of trained model
- run.py - python3 file that utilizes Flask as a back-end web framework
- go.html - html file for web app front end displayed when user enters and submits message
- master.html - html file for web app front end displaying plotly graphs prior to user input

## Setup
- Anaconda Distribution
- IDE such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code


## Project Status
- Work In Progress (WIP) - Attempting to create virtual environment on cloud platform to better showcase application


## Conclusion
 - Machine learning classification model is a powerful tool that can help first responders classify distress messages into categories. This can help first responders provide aid more effectively and timely in a fast-paced, high stress disaster scenario.


## Room for Improvement
- Hyperparameter tuning in random forest classifier. Due to machine processing limitations I only selected n__estimator parameter for optimization. Model can be improved further.
- Training dataset does not include certain categories. No matter how tuned the model is, it cannot overcome a lack of categorical data in the training dataset.
